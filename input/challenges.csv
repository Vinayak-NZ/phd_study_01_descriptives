It is not exclusive to one (696)   group, but also opening and then this is the term, I think I mentioned (697)   at the beginning, using, or looking at a holistic approach to designing (698)   this App. Looking at all the different groups that might be in contact (699)   with this specific target group that you are aiming for with your App. (700)   I think that input from them because sometimes nurses have a completely (701)   different view, for example, than health doctors.
