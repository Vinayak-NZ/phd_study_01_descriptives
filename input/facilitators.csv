We also just went to the wards for hours at a time to see how (84)   the work is done and how everything works just to get an idea about (85)   where are we actually going with that app, so is it a setting where (86)   people have a lot of time to do extra training? Turns out it wasn't, so (87)   we tried to identify possible applications where we could use the app (88)   and where it could have a positive effect by taking part in the (89)   process.	5329	6039	Vinayak	2024-08-01 11:28:57				33	12 Needs analysis		2	Vinayak	2024-07-30 17:59:18	#F6CECE

I think another big part of participatory (119)   research or co-creative is to really identify all possible (120)   stakeholders, so try to have a look beyond normal orders like, for (121)   example, we knew that we were having a German app, but we were also (122)   trying to get people involved who didn't speak German, as well. It's a (123)   very heterogeneous sample of women who give birth, and it's also a very (124)   heterogeneous sample when you look at healthcare workers in obstetrics.	7913	8456	Vinayak	2024-08-01 11:29:31				29	08 Leverage strengths		2	Vinayak	2024-07-30 17:59:18	#D37676

To be successful in terms of feasible and (153)   applicable to routine care, so if we just identify half the (154)   stakeholders, then maybe worst case scenarios that the app is just (155)   useful for half the participants. I think that was the idea that we (156)   tried to identify not only these highly educated German women who (157)   already knew a lot about communication, but also identify people from (158)   different languages and different backgrounds who might not have had (159)   the chance to talk about communication that much and to also create an (160)   app that kind of fits both needs.	10289	10940	Vinayak	2024-08-01 11:30:28				33	12 Needs analysis		2	Vinayak	2024-07-30 17:59:18	#F6CECE

We understand that there's behavioral (257)   determinants that there are social cognitive variables that influence (258)   communication behavior. I think what we tried was to give this (259)   communication behavior a bit of a new twist and not just say, okay, we (260)   have this interaction, we have this encoding and decoding of (261)   information, but we also have the behavior. We have this non-verbal (262)   communication, we have verbal communication and that's a behavior (263)   that's provided by patients, that's a behavior that's used by (264)   healthcare workers, by the partners, or the patients in most cases, and (265)   so on.	16708	17623	Vinayak	2024-08-01 11:31:36				29	08 Leverage strengths		2	Vinayak	2024-07-30 17:59:18	#D37676

For example, we knew that even if people intend to communicate (270)   well, it might not work out because they haven't really planned their (271)   communication, so one big aspect that we decided quite early on for the (272)   app was, for example, to have some informative lessons where people (273)   learned about how to communicate and then to really see how they could (274)   incorporate that into all their life and also into, for example, the (275)   preparation of giving birth or into their work and there was one (276)   planning intervention that was pretty much directly derived from the (277)   Health Action Process Approach (HAPA), the model.	17642	18472	Vinayak	2024-08-01 11:32:04				41	20 Feasible design		2	Vinayak	2024-07-30 17:59:18	#EB7333

Do you think those plans are effective? Do you (281)   think you can actually use them, and if not, what would you need to get (282)   there to really be able to use these plans? Well, that's what we do. We (283)   also understood that communication behavior is not just an isolated (284)   behavior, but it works together with different other things enhancing (285)   patient safety.	18490	18993	Vinayak	2024-08-01 11:32:26				41	20 Feasible design		2	Vinayak	2024-07-30 17:59:18	#EB7333

That was something where (290)   we tried to not only look at the individual, although the app was (291)   conceptualized as an individual app, but we also tried to get the idea (292)   behind it that people don't have much time to do an app so they might (293)   not be able. If someone's giving birth, you can't just take out your (294)   phone and see like, by the way, wait a second, I'll just have a look at (295)   the app and how to communicate well. Yes, so that was some principles (296)   that we tried to keep. If I had to summarize them, it was meeting their (297)   needs, being theoretically grounded, but also being feasible.	19011	19865	Vinayak	2024-08-01 11:32:41				41	20 Feasible design		2	Vinayak	2024-07-30 17:59:18	#EB7333

When we started (309)   developing the app, it was clear that we needed approximately ten (310)   subjects that were part of those lessons and different tasks and so on, (311)   so we started doing one lesson, each person in the team, for example, (312)   and then there was always the next person we gave that to and then (313)   provided feedback, got different ideas, changed that lesson, and then (314)   we would go to the next person.	20429	21020	Vinayak	2024-08-01 11:33:11				31	10 Apadative process		2	Vinayak	2024-07-30 17:59:18	#00FF7F

In the beginning we're talking about the purpose, but then (615)   also talking about structure, and the lessons, then we discuss the next (616)   steps. Who's going to be the primary developer of which lesson? Then (617)   like in the next workshop there was one that was pretty much the whole (618)   day, which was an experience to be in an online workshop the whole day, (619)   but that was actually really good because before that workshop people (620)   made a rough draft of their lesson and then introduced that to all the (621)   people who were involved in that workshop.	42643	43642	Vinayak	2024-08-01 18:56:02				38	17 Facilitation strategies		2	Vinayak	2024-07-30 17:59:18	#80FF00

This reflection has also a lot of feedback process, and (1085)   sometimes you can avoid giving too much feedback by reflecting it in (1086)   the beginning. Therefore, the workshops, or the developers were very (1087)   useful, but also being more a [digital_intervention | Case: A] project with internal workshops (1088)   which were very good so that everyone was on the same page before (1089)   taking action.

I (141)   remember when we evaluated some lessons, it was also clear that some (142)   lessons were too long and we needed to shorten it, or it needs to be (143)   easy to use for the parents.

Also then we changed some responsibilities. She (202)   took responsibility for the clinics when she went back to the (203)   university. She was directly working with the field researchers and (204)   then she was able to translate it to the university and she could (205)   translate the university tasks to us. So it really improved the whole (206)   project. For me it was a turning point, a really good turning point.

Maybe it's (268)   redundant, but we thought about other subgroups of the society and how (269)   they might deal with long COVID. For example, people we know from (270)   research that, for example, women in their thirties to sixties have a (271)   lot of long COVID or are more frequently affected by long COVID. We (272)   asked patients from this subgroup of the population, but we also asked (273)   students how they would deal with long COVID and what then their needs (274)   would be. We try to be very inclusive and try to get different (275)   perspectives and needs of people, so person centred.	16631	17316	Vinayak	2024-08-02 10:19:11				33	12 Needs analysis		2	Vinayak	2024-07-30 17:59:18	#F6CECE

I think to some extent it was because (298)   there were four women and me as just one man. It's just like how women (299)   talk to each other. It's like not that one person has a strong opinion (300)   on something or wants to defend her opinion very, very strongly, but (301)   wants also to hear the opinion of others. I see it like that and we (302)   have to do it like that environment.	18265	18949	Vinayak	2024-08-02 10:19:35				32	11 Transparent communication		2	Vinayak	2024-07-30 17:59:18	#F8ECE0

What's helped me personally was building trust and a (336)   relationship with the person who did the communication from [organisation | Label: BD] to (337)   us and also dealt with the structure of the chatbot and talked with the (338)   programmers and us.	20960	21259	Vinayak	2024-08-02 10:21:08				38	17 Facilitation strategies		2	Vinayak	2024-07-30 17:59:18	#80FF00

It was unspoken that it (341)   would be like that, but that really had helped the process I think.	21260	21537	Vinayak	2024-08-02 10:21:21				24	03 Co-creator exchanges		2	Vinayak	2024-07-30 17:59:18	#E5AE9D

The (343)   clinic, for example, I sent them a list when we were at this point with (344)   content we would like to have because we from the [organisation | Label: BU], we don't know (345)   things about physical conditions in long COVID symptoms like thrombosis (346)   or a headache and what to do if patients have these symptoms. We gave (347)   the clinic these symptoms so that they could develop some interventions (348)   about that. That was also very helpful because I think that chatbot (349)   really profit it about that with that. 	21538	22162	Vinayak	2024-08-02 10:21:41				29	08 Leverage strengths		2	Vinayak	2024-07-30 17:59:18	#D37676
7	12	7	0	47461	Vinayak	2024-07-30 18:19:29		647	31	7	Also being flexible was helpful (350)   because the expectations of each co-creator or at least from our side, (351)   was that you could talk with the chatbot really like typing in (352)   sentences and get replies from the chatbot. At the end, it wasn't like (353)   that. It was more like the chatbot said something to you. Then you can (354)   choose an option what to do next. It was not a real conversation, but (355)   more like a forced conversation. I think being flexible in this respect (356)   was helpful to not be disappointed at the end.	22162	22714	Vinayak	2024-08-02 10:22:00				31	10 Apadative process		2	Vinayak	2024-07-30 17:59:18	#00FF7F

She had the lead in her company and for her at the (364)   end, it seemed like it was very important for her that the chatbot (365)   would run, maybe because she put so much effort in it that it would be (366)   very disappointing if the chatbot doesn't work at the end or if someone (367)   is disappointed with the chatbot.

It's maybe more natural, but (381)   if I would have to say something about that, it was really openness. (382)   Listen to the other person, take that person seriously and don't try to (383)   force too much, even though it would be a subjective impression for (384)   you.	24164	24576	Vinayak	2024-08-02 10:22:40				32	11 Transparent communication		2	Vinayak	2024-07-30 17:59:18	#F8ECE0

At (430)   the beginning, we thought the bot would really look differently than it (431)   looked at the end. It was really good to be flexible in this respect (432)   because the [organisation | Label: BD] company couldn't do anything we wanted. We had to (433)   find different solutions for these parts, for example. Another example (434)   was that we wanted the chatbot to say something to the patients even (435)   though they asked. Things like, “You're doing well at the moment and (436)   others are also doing very badly at the moment because of COVID and you (437)   are not the only one”. Sentences like these. We wanted the chatbot to (438)   do it proactively. It didn't work at the end and it was good to be (439)   flexible, to not be disappointed by other stuff like, the onboarding in (440)   the chatbot was different at the beginning than at the end. We had to (441)   talk about that. That was good from both sides to be flexible with this (442)   respect.	27232	28299	Vinayak	2024-08-02 10:23:43				31	10 Apadative process		2	Vinayak	2024-07-30 17:59:18	#00FF7F

They had the feeling that it's mandatory to do (617)   so. That was a facilitator at the end. Also, I think annoying people is (618)   also helpful. If you write them emails and ask for that, that can also (619)   help.	39606	40126	Vinayak	2024-08-02 10:24:16				45	24 Top-down management		2	Vinayak	2024-07-30 17:59:18	#E0F8E0

They could tell what they would (37)   need in that situation. They had only their perspectives. We also took (38)   other groups of people into account who should imagine what it is like (39)   to have long-COVID. We asked them what they would need in such a (40)   situation. Those perspectives were very helpful because we came up with (41)   the idea that students would need help to finance their studies, for (42)   example, and give them information about very specific things. We then (43)   thought that if we had more time for the chatbot, we could even take (44)   more perspectives into account. So far, we looked only at a few (45)   subgroups of the population but there would be more room for other (46)   people as well because one woman in her forties for example said that (47)   she needs to care for her parents as well as her children so she has a (48)   lot of responsibilities and she would like to have some information (49)   that could help in their daily live for example. I think there are even (50)   more subgroups of the population that need similar information for (51)   themselves.	1822	3075	Vinayak	2024-08-02 10:25:52				33	12 Needs analysis		2	Vinayak	2024-07-30 17:59:18	#F6CECE

We forgot one point because (219)   maybe it was press releases. We had press releases that the clinic (220)   wrote and one we wrote. Based on that, newspapers were interested in (221)   our project. So, they got in touch with [collaborator | Label: B1]. She was then (222)   interviewed. These interviews were highly effective because a lot of (223)   people read them. For example, I think, in the Berliner Tagesspiegel, a (224)   very common newspaper. A lot of people were interested in the project. (225)   The press released themselves. I think they were also very effective. I (226)   think we have, let's say, 500 participants within five or six months. (227)   This is not a lot, but at least they are positively screened. In total, (228)   we had, I think, 1000 participants or so. It's not bad if we say it (229)   like that.	13136	14117	Vinayak	2024-08-02 10:30:24				36	15 Broad recruitment		2	Vinayak	2024-07-30 17:59:18	#D0F5A9

However, there was also an opportunity for us to give feedback (348)   and bring up some other topics. For example, in my research, I worked (349)   on face perception. I informed the participants in that workshop about (350)   how people react to certain facial characteristics and how we perceive (351)   them, for example. That was quite cool because I recently read the (352)   interviews for the chatbots and the responses from the participants. (353)   They mentioned that and were highly interested in that. That was very (354)   nice feedback. They did that, and we could also bring up some stuff.	20657	21389	Vinayak	2024-08-02 10:31:12				31	10 Apadative process		2	Vinayak	2024-07-30 17:59:18	#00FF7F

For example, when I (516)   brought up some topics which they have to deal with and taught them how (517)   to do that, it was easier for them, and they didn't have to take a lot (518)   of brain power on that.
